## Singing Reindeer Mk 2


</div>

### Description

merry new year and a happy christmas to all at PSC.

Inspired by 'Singing Reindeer' by Chris Seelbach at xtCodeId=57776; any votes go to him.

No Screen shot (it's a surprise but check Chris's version for a hint)

I decided to developed a christmas tree using the ideas (and the graphic) in the original. In the process I realised there were some problems in the original (artifacts around the animated bits cleverly hidden by careful backgrounding). I thought I'd try to make a single super deer UserControl but couldn't extract the images from the original controls, so developed mouth and eye UserControls (using the images that I could extract and some screen captures) that are designed to be placed on the main usercontrols.

----

Time presses so not much commentry but will develop it into a tutorial over the break as there is some quite trick stuff going on here.

Thanks Tom Law for catching that I left out the sound files, check the file times, it was laaaaate.
